The project is available mainly as the old design which is present as is in the main master folder downloadable from the gituhub repository and the optimized design which be found at <root_directory>/quartus/optimizedDesign/. 
The IEEE_proposed library is under the folder <root_directory>/quartus/library/vhdl2008c-master the instructions to compile which are given in IEEE_PROPOSED_LIBRARY ppt. 
Matlab files used for non-vhdl conceptual verification are present in <root_directory>/matlab folder. It also contains the script for scalable network generation talked about elsewhere.
Testbenches for old design with wrappers are present in <root_directory>/quartus/testbench folder as legacy. Although not necessary since a better workaround was found.
ModelSimScripts folder contains the modelsim scipts to be used to run the modelsim simulations for optimised design. For old design, simulations were manually simulated.
